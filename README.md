# STRIDECAST

## What does the app do?

StrideCast is a podcast generator aimed at enhancing your walking experience. The app takes in the length of a user's walk and preferred podcast genre, and returns a list of podcasts, where each suggestion will fill up the length of the user's walk. Users can save their playlists by signing up for an account. Their saved playlist lives in Firebase's Real-Time Database, and gets rendered dynamically to the users' library upon user sign in. 

## Tech stack

- React
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Real-Time Database
- RESTful API
- VITE
- HTML
- CSS

## Technical Challenges

- Created a project of this scale in 30 hours spread over three weeks. 

## Pending Improvements

- Instead of saving an entire playlist, enable users to save specific podcasts to curate their own playlist. 
- Allow users to create more than one playlist. 
- Make app responsive.
- Enable email verification for form validation/user authentication.

## Immediate Goals
- Integrate Spotify's API into our platform. This integration will enable users to discover their preferred podcasts on StrideCast, and seamlessly save and listen to them on the go through their Spotify accounts. 

## Bigger picture
- Recreate StrideCast with React Native for the ultimate user experience, TypeScript, Django, and unit testing.
